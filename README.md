# HUBBM-Computer-Networking

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation for Programming Assignment 1 of the BBM 203 course. The assignment involves working with Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and various basic data structures. The primary objective is to simulate and manipulate these data structures to solve the given problems.

## Objectives
- Implement and manipulate basic data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
- Develop a deeper understanding of dynamic memory allocation in C++.
- Work on various algorithms that require stack and queue operations.

## Files
- `main.cpp`: The main driver file that contains the implementation of the required functions.
- `linked_list.h`: Header file containing the definition and implementation of Linked List operations.
- `stack.h`: Header file containing the definition and implementation of Stack operations.
- `queue.h`: Header file containing the definition and implementation of Queue operations.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the code.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

This assignment focuses on implementing and manipulating basic data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The students are required to implement these structures from scratch and perform various operations on them. The assignment is designed to enhance understanding of dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation in C++.
